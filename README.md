# AV1 Photon Noise Tables
This is a general Git repository to store photon noise tables (and scripts) usable with all three main software AV1 encoders and grav1synth.

Simply choose the table most appropriate for your encode resolution and color characteristics. Higher ISOs correspond to higher strengths. If unsure, use the SRGB variants.
